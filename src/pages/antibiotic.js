                              Antibiotics are considered ineffective in the case

                              as influenza and the common cold. <br />
                              The choice of the type of antibiotic depends on
                              the type of bacteria causing the disease, the

                              1. Bactericidal antibiotics <br />
                              It kills and destroys bacteria by preventing the
                              formation of bacterial cell components. <br />
                              2. Bacteriostatic antibiotics <br />
                              It inhibits the growth of bacteria and thus limits
                              their ability to multiply and spread. <br />
                              The mechanism of antibiotic effect against

                              Antibiotics begin to work against the bacteria as
                              soon as they are taken, but their effect do not
                              appear until after 2 to 3 days. <br />
                              How quickly you get better after using antibiotics
                              depends on the type of infection being treated.
                              <br />
                              Usually, the appropriate period for using the
                              antibiotic is from 7 to 14 days, and it can be
                              less than that, and the doctor determines the type
                              of antibiotic appropriate for the infection and
                              the appropriate period. <br />
                              Even if you start to feel better after a few days
                              of using the antibiotic, you must complete the
                              full dose as directed by your doctor to make sure
                              that the infection is completely eliminated and
                              this also helps in reducing the resistance of
                              bacteria to the antibiotics. <br />
                              Therefore, the use of antibiotics should always be
                              under the supervision of a physician.

                              2. Excessive use of antibiotics <br />
                              Using antibiotisc without doctor's instructions or
                              unnecessarily in cases of viral infection.
                              <br />
                              3. Misuse of broad spectrum antibiotics <br />
                              Instead of using narrow-spectrum antibiotics that
                              target the infection-causing bacteria more
                              specifically. <br />
                              4. Overuse of antibiotics in hospitals <br />
                              This also increases the opportunity for many types
                              of microbes to develop resistance to antibiotics.
                              <br />
                              5. Using antibiotics for other incorrect purposes,
                              such as adding them to some types of agricultural
                              feed. <br />
