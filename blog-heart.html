                          For some reason, the heart becomes unable to pump the adequate amount of blood to the rest of
                          the body, so the blood accumulates in the heart chambers and retreats from it to accumulate
                          inside the lungs, causing many health problems.
                          Also, the rest of the bodyâ€™s organs are affected, because the blood is its way to obtain the
                          oxygen which is necessary to complete its vital functions. <br>
                          All of this happens either as a result of weaking of the heart muscle becoming unable to
                          contract to pump blood normally, or it has become more stiff and cannot relax to allow the
                          heart chambers to be filled with blood.
                          Heart failure can occur only on the right side of the heart , on the left side, or both. <br>
                          Heart failure may be a chronic disease whose symptoms remain in the long term, and this
                          represents most cases. It can also occur suddenly and acutely as a result of a heart attack or
                          the heart valves diseases, in this case, symptoms usually improve in a short time.

                          Heart failure is usually happens as a result of another disease that causes the heart to be
                          unable to perform its normal function, and the most common disease is coronary artery disease,
                          which causes narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood and oxygen, and this
                          occurs as a result of the accumulation of fatty deposits in the arteries and lead to lack of
                          blood flow Blood to the heart and may lead to a heart attack if a complete blockage of the
                          coronary artery occurs. <br>

                            its weakness.

                        <p class="p-blog">
                          Heart failure can occur on the right side of the heart, the left side, or both.
                          We will also learn about systolic and diastolic heart failure. <br>

                          1. Left sided Heart failure <br>
                          It is the most common type of heart failure , the left ventricle, located in the lower part of
                          the left side of the heart, is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the body.
                          Left-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle is unable to adequately pump blood, so
                          blood backs up and accumulates in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing and fluid buildup in
                          the body. <br>

                          2. Right sided heart failure <br>
                          The right ventricle is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
                          where gas exchange occurs and is blood is loaded with oxygen,
                          Right sided heart failure occurs when the right ventricle becomes unable to perform its
                          function.
                          It usually occurs as a result of failure of the left side of the heart muscle and fluid
                          buildup in the lungs, which impairs the right ventricle's ability to pump blood to the lungs
                          and makes it more difficult.
                          In this case, fluids refluxe to the abdomen, feet, and legs, causing swelling. <br>

                          3. Systolic heart failure <br>
                          It occurs when the heart muscle becomes weak and loses its ability to contract to pump blood
                          to the body, and this type is more common in men than women. <br>

                          4. Diastolic heart failure <br>
                          In this case, the heart muscle becomes more stiff than normal as a result of other diseases
                          that affect the heart, and the heart loses its ability to relax to be filled with blood, which
                          leads to a lack of blood supply to the rest of the body, and it is more common in women.

                          The doctor begins with taking the patient's medical history and then begins the clinical
                          examination, checking for signs of heart failure, such as arrhythmias, swelling of the feet
                          and legs, and protruding neck veins.
                          After that, the doctor orders some medical tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: <br>

                          1. Echocardiogram<br>
                          It is the most effictive test for diagnosing heart failure, and it uses waves that give a
                          complete picture of the heart, allowing the doctor to know the damage in the heart, and
                          through it also knows the systolic and diastolic capacity of the heart.<br>
                          2 .Chest x-ray<br>
                          3. ECG<br>
                          4. MRI of the heart<br>
                          5. An nuclear scan on the heart<br>
                          6. Diagnostic catheterization of the heart<br>
                          7. Stress test<br>
                          It is a test to measure heart function during exertion.<br>
                          8. Blood cholesterol<br>
                          9. Measuring the level of some peptides in the blood which could be an indicator of heart<br>
                          failure (BNP blood test)

                          Heart failure is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong treatment. The treatment plan
                          depends on the severity of the condition and the type of heart failure.
                          Early detection of the disease and initiation of appropriate treatment greatly improves
                          symptoms and reduces expected complications, follow-up and repeat examinations regularly every
                          three to six months are also important.
