                          Antibiotics come in many forms:

                          Antibiotics are used to treat diseases caused by bacteria, as they prevent the growth of
                          microbes or slow the rate of their reproduction. <br>

                          Antibiotics are considered ineffective in the case of diseases that result from viral
                          infections such as influenza and the common cold. <br>

                          The choice of the type of antibiotic depends on the type of bacteria causing the disease, the
                          health status of the patient, and whether bacteria are resistant to antibiotics or not.

                          There are two types of antibiotics depending on how they work: <br>

                          1. Bactericidal antibiotics <br>
                          It kills and destroys bacteria by preventing the formation of bacterial cell components. <br>
                          2. Bacteriostatic antibiotics <br>
                          It inhibits the growth of bacteria and thus limits their ability to multiply and spread. <br>

                          The mechanism of antibiotic effect against bacteria include the following: <br>

                          Antibiotics begin to work against the bacteria as soon as they are taken, but their effect do
                          not appear until after 2 to 3 days. <br>
                          How quickly you get better after using antibiotics depends on the type of infection being
                          treated. <br>

                          Usually, the appropriate period for using the antibiotic is from 7 to 14 days, and it can be
                          less than that, and the doctor determines the type of antibiotic appropriate for the infection
                          and the appropriate period. <br>

                          Even if you start to feel better after a few days of using the antibiotic, you must complete
                          the full dose as directed by your doctor to make sure that the infection is completely
                          eliminated and this also helps in reducing the resistance of bacteria to the antibiotics. <br>
                          Therefore, the use of antibiotics should always be under the supervision of a physician.

                          With the misusing of antibiotics and , of some types of bacteria change and mutate
                          morphologically, this change protects them from being affected by the drug and weakening its
                          effect on them. <br>

                          Thus, the mutated type of bacteria survives and multiplies, causing the spread of a new type
                          of bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics.

                          1. Gene mutations <br>
                          Changing the DNA of bacteria leads to a mutation that allows bacteria to resist the action of
                          antibiotics, so they can multiply and spread. <br>

                          2. Excessive use of antibiotics <br>
                          Using antibiotisc without doctor's instructions or unnecessarily in cases of viral infection.
                          <br>

                          3. Misuse of broad spectrum antibiotics <br>
                          Instead of using narrow-spectrum antibiotics that target the infection-causing bacteria more
                          specifically. <br>

                          4. Overuse of antibiotics in hospitals <br>
                          This also increases the opportunity for many types of microbes to develop resistance to
                          antibiotics. <br>

                          5. Using antibiotics for other incorrect purposes, such as adding them to some types of

                          which has made many drugs lose their effectiveness against many types of bacteria. <br>

                          So there are a lot of bacterial infections that antibiotics can't completely cure. <br>
                          These types of bacteria are called antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <br>

                          Antibiotics treat infections caused by bacteria, It is misuse of antibiotics for viral
                          infections such as: <br>

                          In the case of using antibiotics in a viral infection, this will cause the drug to attack the
