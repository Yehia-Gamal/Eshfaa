                          Lung cancer is one of the most common types of malignant cancers, which affects the lungs and
                          spreads inside them and can then migrate and spread to the rest of the body. <br>
                          And like malignant tumors, it begins with a disturbance in the growth of cells in the lungs
                          and trachea, where they grow and divide in an abnormally accelerated manner, which leads to
                          the spread of cancer cells and the formation of tumors inside the lungs. <br>

                          Lung cancer is considered one of the fatal cancers, as it is classified as one of the most
                          leading causes to death of all types of cancer, because it destroys the spongy cells of the
                          lungs that supply the body with oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide so that it can perform
                          its vital functions, and lose them the ability to perform their role. <br>

                          Smoking is the most responsible cause for lung cancer in more than 90% of cases, and
                          non-smokers can also get it, but the risk increases with increasing smoking period.

                          Lung cancer may be a silent cancer that can develop without any symptoms until it reaches
                          serious advanced stages of the disease, and this is one of the factors that lead to its
                          classification as a highly dangerous disease. <br>

                          There are some symptoms that can appear in the early stages that indicate the presence of the
                          disease:

                          <li>Coughing with phlegm or blood.</li>
                          <li>Hoarseness and change in voice.</li>

                          But there are some symptoms that are considered as warning signs when they appear, they

                          parts of the body, and the appearance of these symptoms depends on the part of the body to
                          which the disease has spread:

                          There are also some symptoms that may appear as a result of secreting hormone-like substances

                          All people are exposed to lung cancer, but it was found that 90% of cases result from smoking,
                          as lung cells are destroyed with the first exposure of lung cells to cigarette smoke filled
                          with carcinogens, and here the risk of developing the disease increases. <br>

                          Your body may initially be able to deal with the destruction and change that occurs in the
                          cells of the lungs, but with repeated and continuous exposure to damage caused by cigarette
                          smoke, the nature of the cells changes abnormally leading to the formation of cancer cells.
                          <br>
                          Quitting smoking at any stage, even after a prolonged period of smoking, reduces the incidence
                          of lung cancer.

                          It represents 80-85% of lung cancer types, and is divided into several types, most of them
                          respond greatly to treatment if diagnosed in the early stages of the disease. <br>

                          2_ Small cell lung cancer: <br>
                          It represents about 15-20% of lung cancers, and is considered more dangerous than non-small

                          increase lung cancer, you will definitely go to see a doctor to be sure. <br>
                          Diagnosing lung cancer begins with the doctor examining the patient, knowing the symptoms, and
                          taking the full medical history and ordering some tests to prove or deny the disease. <br>

                          1. Examination of blood chemistry. <br>
                          2. Checking the concentration of blood gases. <br>
                          3. Imaging tests: through which tumor masses can be detected

                          6. Taking a biopsy from the lung for examination under the microscope and to determine whether
                          <br>
                          the cells are cancerous or not. <br>
                          7. If the result of the biopsy examination is positive, this will require a bone scan to <br>
                          determine the stage of the disease and the extent of its spread.

                          The treatment program for lung cancer depends on several factors, on the basis of which the
                          treating doctor sets the appropriate program for each patient, and among these factors are the
                          following:
                        <ul class="ul-blog">
                          <li>Age of the patient.</li>
                          <li>General health status.</li>
                          <li>The type of lung cancer.</li>
                          <li>The stage of the disease.</li>
                          <li>Extent of its spread.</li>
                          <li>The location and size of the tumor.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="p-blog">
                          1. Surgical intervention: <br>

                          Surgical intervention is one of the first options, especially in the first or second stage of
                          the disease, the tumor and part of the healthy cells around it are removed, and lymph nodes
                          can also be removed for examination. <br>

                          Chemotherapy or radiotherapy are used before surgery in case of large tumers to reduce its
                          size before excision, and it can also be used after surgical intervention if there is a chance
                          for cancerous cells to return again. <br>

                          2. Radiotherapy: <br>
                          High-energy beams of X-rays and protons are used and directed at tiny points on the body to
                          destroy cancer cells. <br>
                          It may help relieve symptoms associated with cancer, such as pain, and is used before or after
                          surgery and is usually combined with chemotherapy. <br>

                          3. Chemotherapy: <br>
                          These are certain medications taken by mouth or injected into a vein to destroy cancer cells.
                          They are used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and to prevent them from
                          spreading again. <br>


                          4. Immunotherapy: <br>
                          In some advanced stages of cancer, the body's immune system may be unable to confront cancer
                          cells that adopt a way to escape from the immune system. In these cases, immunotherapy is used
                          to help the body control the disease. <br>

                          5. Palliative care: <br>
                          Lung cancer and the side effects of treatments cause severe and painful symptoms for patients,
                          and it is necessary to focus on some treatment methods to reduce the severity of these
                          symptoms. <br>
                          In addition , some people in the advanced stages of the disease can choose not to complete the
                          treatment plan, this is where the role of palliative care comes in relieving symptoms of the
                          disease rather than treating the cancer itself.

                          Always early diagnosis of any disease increases the rate of cure, as well as in the case of
                          lung cancer. <br>
                          The chance of surviving lung cancer in general depends on the type of cancer and its stage
                          when it was discovered. The longevity of a lung cancer patient depends on his age, his general
                          health condition, and the extent of the disease’s response to treatment. <br>
                          So, if lung cancer is detected early and the patient receives appropriate treatment for his
                          condition, this increases the cure rate and the chance of survival for five years to 50-53%.
