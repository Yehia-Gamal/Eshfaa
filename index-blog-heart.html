                        <p class="p-blog">
                          For some reason, the heart becomes unable to pump the adequate amount of blood to the rest of
                          the body, so the blood accumulates in the heart chambers and retreats from it to accumulate
                          inside the lungs, causing many health problems.
                          Also, the rest of the body’s organs are affected, because the blood is its way to obtain the
                          oxygen which is necessary to complete its vital functions. <br>
                          All of this happens either as a result of weaking of the heart muscle becoming unable to
                          contract to pump blood normally, or it has become more stiff and cannot relax to allow the
                          heart chambers to be filled with blood.
                          Heart failure can occur only on the right side of the heart , on the left side, or both. <br>
                          Heart failure may be a chronic disease whose symptoms remain in the long term, and this
                          represents most cases. It can also occur suddenly and acutely as a result of a heart attack or
                          the heart valves diseases, in this case, symptoms usually improve in a short time.

                          Heart failure is usually happens as a result of another disease that causes the heart to be
                          unable to perform its normal function, and the most common disease is coronary artery disease,
                          which causes narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood and oxygen, and this
                          occurs as a result of the accumulation of fatty deposits in the arteries and lead to lack of
                          blood flow Blood to the heart and may lead to a heart attack if a complete blockage of the
                          coronary artery occurs. <br>
                          There are many other reasons such as:

                            <br> Healthy heart valves keep blood flowing in the right direction, and when any damage
                            occurs to them, that increase load on the heart and needs to work harder, which will lead to
                            its weakness.

                        <img class="img-blog" src="images/gallery/heart/heart-07-en.WebP" alt="">
                        <p class="p-blog">
                          Heart failure can occur on the right side of the heart, the left side, or both.
                          We will also learn about systolic and diastolic heart failure. <br>

                          1. Left sided Heart failure <br>
                          It is the most common type of heart failure , the left ventricle, located in the lower part of
                          the left side of the heart, is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the body.
                          Left-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle is unable to adequately pump blood, so
                          blood backs up and accumulates in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing and fluid buildup in
                          the body. <br>

                          2. Right sided heart failure <br>
                          The right ventricle is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
                          where gas exchange occurs and is blood is loaded with oxygen,
                          Right sided heart failure occurs when the right ventricle becomes unable to perform its
                          function.
                          It usually occurs as a result of failure of the left side of the heart muscle and fluid
                          buildup in the lungs, which impairs the right ventricle's ability to pump blood to the lungs
                          and makes it more difficult.
                          In this case, fluids refluxe to the abdomen, feet, and legs, causing swelling. <br>

                          3. Systolic heart failure <br>
                          It occurs when the heart muscle becomes weak and loses its ability to contract to pump blood
                          to the body, and this type is more common in men than women. <br>

                          4. Diastolic heart failure <br>
                          In this case, the heart muscle becomes more stiff than normal as a result of other diseases
                          that affect the heart, and the heart loses its ability to relax to be filled with blood, which
                          leads to a lack of blood supply to the rest of the body, and it is more common in women.

                          complete picture of the heart, allowing the doctor to know the damage in the heart, and
                          through it also knows the systolic and diastolic capacity of the heart.<br>
                          2 .Chest x-ray<br>
